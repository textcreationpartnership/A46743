            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Worſhipful my much honored Friend, The Lady <hi>Cecilia Knollys,</hi> All Health and Happineſs in the Lord.</head>
            <p>IT is a very comfortable priviledge (good Madam) vouchſafed to ſincere and faithful Chriſtians, that being <hi>planted in the houſe of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 92.14.</note> they ſhall <hi>ſtill bring forth fruit in old age;</hi> when other trees grow doddick and paſt fruit-bearing, theſe trees of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs (by a ſingular bleſſing from God) ſhall be able to yield <hi>the fruits of the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5 21.</note> for the honor of God who planted them, and for the good of that Chriſtian community whereof they are members. They are more in prayer, and more in magnifying the grace whereby they ſtand; more in their meditations of God and the things of God; more in their preparations for death, and for an entrance into the everlaſting Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt; more in imparting experiences of the gracious dealings of God with themſelves and others, for helping the troubled ſpirits of their brethren; more free in Alms-deeds and all good uſes, according to ability; more mortified to the world, and to their paſſions; more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Church in whoſe proſperity they rejoyce, and grieve in the adverſity: and better redeem the time whereof they ſee ſo little remaining.</p>
            <p>Though they be infeſted with their infirmities of old age, and with divers incumbrances of the world, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in old age they mind the doing of good, yea more good then they were wont to do; as willing to the uttermoſt (while they may) to <hi>ſhew forth the praiſes of Him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2 9.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:33165:3"/> light.</hi> The recompence of reward draws nearer and nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and in little time will be fully in their poſſeſſion; therefore for the inch of time that remains in this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, they will work as faſt as they can, with all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, carefulneſs, and chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>And this their priviledge ſtands upon ſundry unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grounds, as, The eternal love and counſel of God, who enables them to perſevere and be fruitful; The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious interceſſion and powerful grace of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 15.5.</note> in whom they are as <hi>branches in their Vine:</hi> The effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual working of Gods bleſſed Spirit, who is promiſed to <hi>abide with them for ever:</hi>
               <note place="margin">14.16.</note> The immortal and <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed of the word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.13.</note> whereof they are <hi>born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> and cannot periſh for ever: The faithful and ſtedfaſt Covenant of grace,<note place="margin">Jer. 32.40.</note> which as it engageth God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>depart from them,</hi> but do them good, ſo it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants them freſh abilities, that they ſhall <hi>never depart from their God,</hi> together with promiſes in particular; and divers helps both to hold out to the end, and to <hi>bring forth fruit ſtill in old age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I write (good Madam) to comfort you in this your age, and againſt the many infirmities which accompany it. The Lord adde unto your days abundantly, and give you yet to ſee the peace of his Jeruſalem. Many good fruits you have born already, and we rejoyce in ſeeing them; your love to the Houſe and Ordinances of God, which ſometimes you frequent with danger to your health; your love to godly Miniſters, whom you eſteem worthy of double honour; the religious ordering of your Family; the careful obſervation of the Lords Day, which with many is almoſt out of requeſt; the large proviſion you make weekly for poor people, with other good fruits,
<pb facs="tcp:33165:3"/> which will <hi>abound to your account</hi> in that great day of Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.17.</note> Go on (good Madam) and <hi>never be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in well-doing,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.9.</note> in due time you ſhall reap if you faint not;</hi> and (according to the premiſſes) you ſhall be ſure in this holy way never to faint; for, <hi>the way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10.29.</note> and the whole ſtream of the Scriptures runs for your encouragement.</p>
            <p>At this time I make bold to preſent your Ladyſhip with theſe brief and plain Meditations, and pray your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as from one who deſires to acknowledge the grace of God in you, and to help you along to the end of your courſe with much joy and aſſurance, humbly taking my leave in preſent, and unto death remaining</p>

            <head>To the Practitioner in Religion.</head>
            <p>GOod friend, here I preſent thee with a few plain and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Obſervations on the Book of <hi>Jonah.</hi> Learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſcourſes, he that is willing, may find in thoſe great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our Iſrael,<note place="margin">A. Abbot. B. King.</note> who many yeares ago wrote on this Propheſie, which yet is rather an Hiſtory: And this preſent endeavour need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, but to revive thoſe Notions which lie hid from the moſt: and plain people will beſt reliſh plain and ſhort Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>Yet if we conſider the matters herein contained, we ſhall find ſome of them lofty,<note place="margin">Hieron. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em. in Jonam.</note> and fit for deep meditations. Some Hebrew Doctors ſay, that this <hi>Jonah</hi> was ſon of the widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> whom <hi>Eliahs</hi> raiſed from the dead: which if it be true, we meet with a wonder, both ſtrange, and not exemplified in any other. Here are three reſurrectians for one Saint; firſt in that he was raiſed by the Prophet <hi>Eliah;</hi> next that he recovered out of the belly of the Whale (wherein he was a figure of our Saviours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection) and last of all,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.39.40.</note> that in the generall reſurrection he ſhall come again with his body, and for ever be with the Lord. It is alſo a wonder in this Book, that the providence of our God is ſo preſent with his people, and of ſo large extent among the creatures, both ſmall and great. It is a wonder that <hi>Jonah</hi> ſhould ſo long ſubſiſt in the Whales belly, and at three dayes end be ſet on land again, and do the meſſage which formerly he had ſo ſtifly refuſed to do. It is a wonder, that in a little time he reaped more fruit of his Miniſtry among heatheniſh <hi>Ninevites,</hi> then in a long time he had reaped among Gods own people. It is a wonder, that after his miraculous deliverance out of the Fiſh, and after his holy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be wholly for the Lord, yet he ſhould be ſtout and ſturdy about the ſparing of <hi>Nineve,</hi> the Lord beſpeaking him very mildely, and he replying upon the Lord very peeviſhly.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:33165:4"/>
            <p>Chriſtian, there is ſomething to be pickt out of theſe and other paſſages for thy edification. Let the <hi>brevity</hi> of the Notes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thee to fall into large meditations, and applications to thine own ſoul. And let the <hi>plainneſſe</hi> of them, which ſaves the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of farther inquiry, occaſion thee to deal the more ſeriouſly with thy conſcience, that thou mayeſt be brought to an entire eſtate of faith and obedience. Certainly,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> as <hi>all Scripture is written for our inſtruction,</hi> ſo this concerning <hi>Jonah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His example gives us fair warning, not to leave known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whatever carnal reaſonings may ſuggeſt for the neglect of them: Not to ſleep or reſt ſecure after any ſin committed, leſt a storm from God fall upon us, and endanger our comfort in God, if not our ſalvation: Not to be eager for the deſtruction of any, though bad enough, and they deſerve to be deſtroyed: Not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that cholerick diſpoſition, which we know to reſt in ſome of our breaſts, but be very watchful, and mortifie this corruption more and more: Nor to mutter againſt any of Gods dealings, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our ſelves or others, how croſſe ſoever they ſeem to be.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Jonah</hi>'s example warns us to ſhame our ſelves for errors we have made, as he here doth in writing theſe things of himſelf: To ſubmit patiently (as he doth) to thoſe fatherly chaſtiſements, which it pleaſeth God to afflict us withall: To retain faith in God, even in the depth of our afflictions, as doth he: To vent our faith and faithful deſires by hearty and earneſt prayers, and that without ceaſing, as did he till he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: To gather holy vows and purpoſes, that upon recovery out of any evils we will (by the aſſiſtance of grace) ſhew our ſelves really thankful for mercies received: And after all our fooliſh ſtrivings with his ſad diſpenſations,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> we will reſolve all into the good pleaſure of our God: <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth good in his eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then out of the example of the <hi>Ninevites</hi> all ſhould learn to believe the threats of God, and be humbled, and crave the peace with God, and walk with him ever afterward more obediently and carefully:<note place="margin">Rab. in Seder, Olam. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorer. &amp; alii.</note> Where mark thoſe words <hi>(ever afterward)</hi> and beware of relapſes, or returning to folly. Hiſtories tell us, how
<pb facs="tcp:33165:5"/> forty yeares after this ſparing of <hi>Nineve,</hi> yet the people falling back to their old ſins again, were fearfully deſtroyed by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their City utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, according to the Propheſie of <hi>Nahum,</hi> who aroſe after our <hi>Jonah.</hi> Beware (Chriſtians) by their example. Be not as the <hi>Dog</hi> that returns to his vomit, or as the <hi>Sow</hi> that was waſhed, to the wallowing in the mire. The firſt eſtate of Apoſtates was bad enough, but their laſt eſtate is worſe by far.</p>
            <p>The Lord uphold us in theſe ſifting and ſhaking times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many have turned aſide after Satan, that we may hold on conſtantly in the way of faith and obedience, not warping aſide to the right hand or the left: no nor abating a whit of our <hi>firſt love,</hi> through heavineſſe of fleſh, or deadneſſe of ſpirit, or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances of the world: With which prayer I reſt in preſent,</p>

            <p n="2">2. To <hi>Nineve</hi> he is ſent with the mournful Voice of a Dove, proclaiming their deſtruction, <hi>Yet forty dayes and Nineve ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> but with an intent in the Maſter that ſent him, to ſpare the City upon their Repentance and Amendment.

               <note place="margin">Two Notes more. 1.</note>Out of this Book of <hi>Jonah</hi> two things may be noted, by the expoſition of our Saviour himſelf. 1. That <hi>Jonah</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, in reſpect of his Death and Reſurrection;

The Jeſuite needed not to have quarrelled about ſuch ſenſe of Scriptures: but, under pretence of Allegories, we muſt not run out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fooleries as are many of their Allegories, much leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Errors as ſome of them are.

            <p>Come we now to the Book it ſelf;<note place="margin">Contents of this Book.</note> This Book of <hi>Jonah</hi> contains many chief points concerning the Knowledge of God, and the Salvation of man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For God, we may here ſee and admire his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in ſending to the Heathen <hi>Ninevites,</hi> that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be ſaved; even at that time, when generally he took <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his only, peculiar, choſen people: Poſſibly a ſign of the calling of the Gentiles, which ſhould follow afterward. And the <hi>justice</hi> of God, who ſo ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged the diſobedience of his own Servant <hi>Jonah;</hi> after whom, all may learn to take heed of turning the grace of God into laſciviouſneſs. And the <hi>power</hi> of God, who hath all the Creatures, even the rudeſt, at his own beck and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal; the Winds, the Sea, the Fiſhes, the Herbs and Plants, and all the Creation. And his <hi>providence,</hi> who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33165:7"/> provides both for the puniſhment and for the relief of <hi>Jonah;</hi> and, by both of them, an wholſome inſtruction for him; to be ruled by him for time to come, better then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and for us alſo, who need ſuch Diſcipline.</p>
            <p n="2"> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. For Man and his Salvation, we ſee by this Book, how far we are fallen into Sin and Miſery; even ſo far, that without the mighty and merciful hand of God we cannot recover our ſelves, no more then <hi>Jonah</hi> could. And, to them that are troubled at the ſight of their ſin and danger, there is Mercy in ſtore by Jeſus Chriſt, as there was for <hi>Jonah.</hi> And the way is, to believe the Preaching of the word, and repent, and turn from our evil wayes, as did the <hi>Ninevites.</hi> Here we have alſo the force of Prayer, the nature of Fear, the wages of Diſobedience, the fruit of Repentance. Here we have Lots, Vows, ſinging of Pſalms, Hiſtory ſtrange and wonderful, and a new kind of Creation, in the Gourd that roſe up in a Night; with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitable Documents, as God ſhall bring us to them in order.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Parts.</note>In the Book we have a firſt and ſecond calling of <hi>Jonah</hi> to Preach to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> with the things that followed upon both of them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Take pains to know the meaning of the Prophets in their ſeveral Propheſies; There are obſcurities in them; but ſearch to underſtand them more fully and clearly; <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5.39. Read, Hear, Pray, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33165:8"/> Obey, any thing to get out the hidden treaſure; Be both frequent and earneſt in ſearching out the meaning of places; Dig, Cry, lift up your Voice for underſtanding; plain Apoſtles feed the ſimple, hard Prophets exerciſe the more witty and underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be reverent in all your converſing with the word, whether by Reading or Hearing. King <hi>Eglon ſtood up</hi> to receive <hi>Ehuds</hi> Meſſage from the Lord. <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company ſet themſelves <hi>in the preſence of God,</hi> to hear what ſhould be ſpoken by <hi>Peter.</hi> The Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in hearing ſome Meſſage from God, bowed their head and worſhpped; even ſo do ye; <hi>take heed</hi> to the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>give earneſt heed</hi> to the things that are ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Believe all that the Prophets have written;</hi> not as the <hi>ſlow of heart,</hi> whom our Saviour reproved, or as thoſe now-a-days who deſerve to be reproved: <hi>King Agrippa, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt thou the Prophets?</hi> I wiſh I could ſay of every one, I know thou believeſt.

               <p n="4">4. Obey the Voice of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Voice of the Lord. When God delivered the Commandements, <hi>Iſrael</hi> made account they muſt obey all that he ſaid, and promiſed ſo to do, and (ſaid he) <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them!</hi> It had been well for them, and it would be well for us, if ſo pliant and obedient: Conſider our Reading, Hearing, Praying, Conferring, is all to be referred to obeying; Obeying hath the promiſe, as is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it;</hi> and, <hi>Hearers of</hi> the Law ſhall be bleſſed <hi>in the deed.</hi>

                  <p>Six brief Notes may hence be collected.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That they tell of their ſins, though it tend to their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33165:14"/> ſhame; it makes for the glory of God in pardoning and reſtoring them, and therefore they care not though they lay load upon themſelves; ſo did <hi>Jonah</hi> here. <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote of his unbelief and haſtineſs, <hi>David</hi> of his Murder and Adultery, <hi>Paul</hi> how he had been a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, and injurious. That God may forget, it is good for us to remember and confeſs our ſins; And the Church receives inſtruction by the fall of the Saints, as well as by their good examples, and comfort to them that have fallen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they tell of their obſcure beginnings. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells how he kept ſheep at the mount <hi>Sinai. Amos</hi> how he had been an Herdſman, and a gatherer of Sycomore fruits. <hi>Matthew</hi> how he had ſate at the Receipt of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</p>
                  <p>No matter how poor and mean a man was at his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if afterward he be endued with the grace of God, and ſet upon work to do for his Majeſty. Let none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe a faithful ſervant of God for former obſcurities, or defaults that were made; <hi>Who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmal things?</hi>

Do they not breath forth a Divine Spirit? if it were only hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, they would never have ſo deſcribed their Sins and Errours, nor yet Obſcurities: and if it be Divine, cloſe with it, reverence it, believe it, obey it, take comfort and direction by it.

                  <p>For the lots which theſe Mariners uſed to find the cauſe of their diſtreſſe and danger, thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">What a lot is.</note> 
                     <hi>A lot is ſuch a thing as in the doubts of men doth ſhew the will of God:</hi> Or, <hi>A lot is an Ordinance of God, whereby we put that unto God which men could not decide.</hi> It is commonly by Divines referred to the third Commandement, as part of Gods Name which muſt not be <hi>taken in vain.</hi> We know a man by his Name, and by a lot we come to know the mind and will of God in a matter which we cannot know by our ſelves, nor by others.</p>
                  <p>Of a lot I deliver theſe particulars,<note place="margin">Particulars.</note> that the nature of the Ordinance may be the more manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The matter of caſting lots muſt be <hi>a weighty and grave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> matter;</hi> which is well worth the finding, and well becomes the Majeſty of the great God to be employed about, not in every triflle, as in drawing of Cuts; So here, a great tempeſt was upon the Mariners, and thereby great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; a great offence had cauſed it; they knew not what the offence was; they deſired deliverance; life and all was in queſtion, and now they go to caſting of lots; not as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be an Ordinance of God, but only led by the dim Light of Nature, which ſuggſted this might be a way to find out the truth, as in the event it proved. So in an Oath, which is the <hi>end of Controverſies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This weighty matter muſt be ſuch as none but God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doth know and can determine; and herein differs from an Oath, that he who ſwears, knows the thing he affirms or denies to be a very truth, and calls God to witneſs of it; but in a lot none knows but God alone, as here, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſhould be the cauſe of this tempeſt; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners knew nothing of it till the lot fell upon <hi>Jonah;</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> muſt tell what he had done. So in other inſtances of Scripture, <hi>v. c.</hi> about <hi>Achan</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We read how all the determination of lots is from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.33. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33165:28"/> diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord.</hi> God is not wanting to his own Ordinance; but when he is ſought by his people, he will be found of them; this alſo appears by the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and other of the like nature.</p>
                  <p n="4"> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. We read what is the end of caſting lots; to wit, quietly to determine buſineſſes which could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe decided without ſtrife of ſeveral parties. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.18. <hi>The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and parteth between the mighty;</hi> as if it be in deliberation, which of theſe Nobles ſhall be ſent Ambaſſadour to ſuch a Prince? which of theſe Warriors ſhall be put upon ſuch a sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. There are three ſorts of lots, according to the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold uſe of them; two of them lawful, the third unlawful, wicked, diveliſh. Take heed, and eaſt lots as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Sortes Diviſionis;</hi> when Houſes, or Lands, or other Goods are to be divided between man and man, about which otherwiſe contention would ariſe; ſo <hi>Joſhua</hi> by lot divided the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> among the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo Merchants ſometimes divide their parcels of Wares, and Neighbours divide their Acres of Ground; Lot-Acres, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Sortes Conſultationis;</hi> when we adviſe together what is fit to be done, but in Concluſion cannot agree becauſe things ſtand in the Equality of Reaſon: Here it is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God by lot, and ſo all parties are contented. So the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by lot choſe <hi>Matthias</hi> to be an Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.26. So theſe Mariners by lot would know who brought this great Tempeſt upon them in their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Though there might be ſuperſtition in their, doing it, yet the thing for ſubſtance was good and lawful.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Sortes Divinationis;</hi> when wicked men inquire into fortunate and infortunate dayes for a journey that is to be taken, or a buſineſs that is to be done; if they draw a

                  <p>A ſinful abuſe of Gods Ordinance;<note place="margin">Abuſe.</note> as it is alſo to turn lots into ſports, or to fore-tell things for gain, as do the Gipſies; and thoſe that aſcribe the iſſue of lots to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, <hi>The Goddeſs of Fools;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Te facimas fortuna deam, coeloque loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> whereas indeed the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of it is of the Lord; and theſe three caſes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhew the truth of the things ſo ordered; <hi>Jonathan, Achan,</hi> and <hi>Jonah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Application of this Doctrine take thus.</p>

Now the greater our danger is, and rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, the more we hold our ſelves bound to thankfulneſs; but rightly apprehended it cannot be without deep and earneſt Meditation. Think a little in what a woful caſe theſe Mariners were during the Tempeſt; then compare the infinite waath of the great God, which burns to the nethermoſt hell; and all by reaſon of thoſe pleaſant and profitable ſins thou ſo much doateſt upon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="2">2. True hope is grounded in faith, and in reconcilation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with God thereby. We hope well, becauſe we know whom we beleeve, and he is <hi>the hope of Iſrael,</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Jonah</hi> we ſee the example of a froward and waſpiſh Saint, who too much cleaves to his own reaſon, without due reſpect had to the will of God, or to the good of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

But, it <hi>displeaſed him exceedingly;</hi> that is, that the Lord <hi>did not the evil which he ſaid he would do to</hi> Nineve. And why ſo? becauſe now he ſhould be accounted a falſe Prophets and God who ſaid <hi>Nineve</hi> ſhould be <hi>overthrown,</hi> ſhould be blaſphemed as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, and not true of his word; as not only the heathens round about, but even the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves would be ready to jeer at his coming home among them: A goodly meſſenger and meſſage! and hereafter we will not regard thee a whit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It displeaſed</hi> Jonah <hi>exceedingly, and he was very angry.</hi>

                  <p>Some ſay he was offended at the calling of the Gentiles, as thoſe in <hi>Act.</hi> 11. and 22. and that by the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie he, foreſaw the rejection of the Jews, into whoſe room the Gentiles were to ſucceed.

                  <p>Here let none take up an evil thought, as if excuſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath faithfully laboured for what he hath gotten. Other Scriptures require it of the painfull and laborious; or tell how <hi>God gives ſtrength to get ſubſtance,</hi> Deut 8 18. and, how without the bleſſing of God all a mans labor will com to nothing, Pſ. 127.1, 2. Still therefore he is the great Benefactor, and muſt be ſo acknowledged. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, and ſome grace from him, thou hadſt been idle, raſh, undiſcreet a ſpend-thrift, or croſt in thy way of getting.</p>
                  <p>Much leſſe think, What need I labour if God gives his bleſſings to them that labour not? Not ſo: for he hath ſet an order from the beginning of the world, that in the ſweat of our brows we muſt eat our bread.

                  <p>So in ſpiritual things: all are bound to a diligent and conſcionable uſe of the means of grace, whereby they may get into the favor of God, and be ſaved.

                  <p>The Lord ſees and reſpects the multitudes of people that are in the world, young and old, infants and all that know not the right hand from the left; one hundred and twenty thouſand of them, millions in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in Grand <hi>Cairo, Paris,</hi> other great Cities; one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand families of Jews in <hi>Alexandria</hi> beſide the other Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, four hundred twenty and eight thouſand heads at <hi>Rome</hi> upon a juſt accompt; ſo of others, <hi>London, York, Briſtol,</hi> all particular Towns and Countreys.

If they were grown up, and able to ſhift for themſelves, I ſhould care the leſſe: but they are young and tender, and my heart is much troubled for them. Now remember wbo looked upon <hi>Nineve,</hi> and there noted <hi>ſix ſcore thouſand</hi> who could not diſcern between the right hand and the left. And he is the ſame God ſtill, infinite in all his Attributes, and as loving to our little ones as ever he was to theſe of <hi>Nineve:</hi> one of them far better then all the Ravens in the world, and yet God feeds every of them: and the Angels have a charge of our Children as well as of our ſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. and it hath been ſeen, that God hath raiſed poor mens Children, and <hi>ſet them among Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> Pſal. 113.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Onely let Parents be adviſed in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To lay hold upon the Covenant for themſelves and their little ones: get God to be thy God, and the God of thine. A careleſſe Parent in this reſpect is but a ſorry friend to his poor Babes. Mark to whom the bleſſing is entailed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103 17, 18. <hi>The mercy of nhe Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him, and his righteouſneſſe unto childrens children: To ſuch as keep his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to thoſe that remember his commandements to do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To pray for their Children, that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:33165:113"/> in ſpecial love, and find mercy with the Lord; as did Father <hi>Abraham, Oh that Iſmael might live in thy ſight!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> He that can pray, ſhould exerciſe his gift in praying for his poor Children. As for the Church, State, health, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, other intereſts, ſo ſpecially for the ſouls of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and their eternal welfare.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To give them religious education: bringing them up <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> as Parents are commanded, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. It muſt not be onely civil educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but religious. So did Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and found it the way to obtain <hi>a bleſſing,</hi> Gen. 18.19. <hi>That the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> So did <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Solomon.</hi> So did <hi>Lois</hi> and <hi>Eunice</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi> And ſo do thou to thine.</p>
                  <p>And when this is done, be quiet, commit them to God and his providence, hope well of them even in dying: <hi>his ſeed ſhall inherit the bleſſing.</hi> Or if they miſcarry, it is their own fault, who fell from their good education, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited your prayers, and Gods bleſſing withall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſaw on Chap. 3. that even <hi>the leaſt in Nineve</hi>

                  <p>They that bear a part in dayes of humiliation and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall find mercy with God in an evil time.

                  <p>Obſerve here: the Jews had a ſolemn Faſt once every year, wherein they were to <hi>afflict their ſouls for ſin,</hi> that they might find favour in the ſight of God: And of this day two things are affirmed.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Lev. 23.27.</note>1. That it was a <hi>day of atonement,</hi> that is, they ſhould have their ſins pardoned, namely in the blood of Chriſt who ſhould come, figured in the blood of the ſacrifices: Chriſt is <hi>the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the world.</hi> Now this forgiveneſſe of ſins is the <hi>bleſſedneſſe of a man,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith out of <hi>David,</hi> Rom. 4.6. So that the everlaſting welfare of a ſinful ſoul depends upon the due humiliation for ſin.</p>
